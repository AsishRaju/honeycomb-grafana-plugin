# Usage Guide

## Time series panel

Best for: visualizing metric trends over time with optional high-cardinality breakdown.

### Example: P99 latency by service

1. Add a **Time series** panel.
2. Select the **Honeycomb** datasource.
3. **Dataset:** `production`
4. **Calculations:** `P99` on column `duration_ms`
5. **Group by:** `service.name`
6. **Order by:** `P99(duration_ms)` descending
7. **Limit:** `10` (top 10 services)
8. **Granularity:** `0` (auto)
9. Click **Run query**

Each `service.name` value produces a separate series. The legend shows `P99(duration_ms) {service.name=api-server}`.

Click any data point → **Open in Honeycomb** to jump to the corresponding Honeycomb query result.

## Table panel

Best for: ranked breakdowns, multi-metric summaries.

**Key difference from timeseries:** table mode sends `disable_series=true` to Honeycomb, which disables timeseries data but allows limits up to 10000 (vs 1000 for timeseries mode).

### Example: Top endpoints by error rate

1. Add a **Table** panel.
2. Query mode: **Table**
3. **Calculations:** `COUNT`, `P99` on `duration_ms`
4. **Filters:** `http.status_code >= 400`
5. **Group by:** `http.target`, `service.name`
6. **Order by:** `COUNT` descending
7. **Limit:** `50`

The table has columns: `http.target`, `service.name`, `COUNT`, `P99(duration_ms)`.

---

## Stat panel

Best for: single aggregate values, SLO-style metrics.

### Example: Total request count in the selected time range

1. Add a **Stat** panel.
2. Query mode: **Stat**
3. **Calculations:** `COUNT`
4. No breakdowns, no filters
5. **Limit:** `1`

Returns a single number representing total events in the panel's time window.

## Using dashboard variables

### Create a dataset variable

1. Go to **Dashboard settings → Variables → Add variable**.
2. Type: **Query**
3. Data source: **Honeycomb**
4. Query type: **Datasets**
5. Name: `dataset`
6. Save

Now `$dataset` is available in all panel queries. Users can switch datasets from the dashboard dropdown.

### Create a column variable

1. Add another variable with type **Query**.
2. Query type: **Columns**
3. Dataset: `$dataset` (uses the dataset variable)
4. Name: `breakdown_column`

Use `$breakdown_column` in the **Group by** field of your panel queries to let users choose the breakdown dimension interactively.

## Raw JSON mode

Power users can bypass the visual editor and write raw Honeycomb Query API JSON:

```json
{
  "calculations": [
    {"op": "COUNT"},
    {"op": "P99", "column": "duration_ms", "alias": "p99_latency"}
  ],
  "breakdowns": ["service.name", "http.status_code"],
  "filters": [
    {"column": "http.status_code", "op": ">=", "value": 400}
  ],
  "filter_combination": "AND",
  "orders": [
    {"op": "COUNT", "order": "descending"}
  ],
  "limit": 25
}
```

Time range is NOT specified in raw JSON — it is applied by the plugin from Grafana's panel time range. Dashboard template variables (`$var`) are substituted before the JSON is sent.

---

## Annotations

Use Honeycomb queries as annotation sources:

1. Open **Dashboard settings → Annotations → Add annotation rule**.
2. Data source: **Honeycomb**
3. Configure a query (same fields as a panel query).
4. The annotation title is built from calculation values; clicking the annotation opens the Honeycomb query result.

---

## Deep links

Every Honeycomb-backed panel includes a deep link to the Honeycomb query result. To use it:

1. Hover over any data point in a timeseries or table.
2. In the tooltip or context menu, click **Open in Honeycomb**.
3. The Honeycomb UI opens in a new tab, showing the exact query result that produced the data.

The link is persistent — you can bookmark it or share it with colleagues.

---

## Alerting

This plugin supports Grafana Alerting. To create an alert:

1. In a panel, switch to the **Alert** tab.
2. Define an alert condition based on the query result.
3. Grafana evaluates the alert on the configured schedule, using the same backend plugin code path as panel queries (including caching).

**Note on caching and alerting:** The token bucket and cache protect both panel queries and alert evaluations. If alert evaluations are frequent (e.g., every 1 minute) and exceed the token budget, alert evaluations may queue. Space alert evaluation intervals to account for the 10 req/min limit.

## Best queries for this plugin

The plugin works best for:

- **Aggregate timeseries**: `COUNT`, `AVG`, `P99` over time — the plugin's cache provides maximum benefit here
- **High-cardinality breakdown tables**: top-N by service, endpoint, user, region — use table mode for limits up to 10000
- **SLO stat panels**: single value with no breakdown, refreshed infrequently
- **Dashboard variable population**: `datasets` and `columns` queries are cheap and cached separately

The plugin works least well for:
- **Extremely high refresh rates** (< 60 s) — the L2/L3 cache still helps, but cold-start latency is 1–3 s per unique query
- **Large number of distinct queries** (> 8 unique queries/minute on a cold dashboard) — token bucket queuing applies
- **Real-time streaming** — not supported; polling max 30 s per query
